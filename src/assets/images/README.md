# Images Directory

Place your images here. They can be imported in React components like:

```jsx
import logo from "../assets/images/logo.png";

// Then use it
<img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
```

## Recommended Structure:

- `/logo/` - Brand logos
- `/team/` - Team member photos
- `/projects/` - Project screenshots
- `/gallery/` - Gallery images
- `/icons/` - Custom icons (if not using react-icons)
